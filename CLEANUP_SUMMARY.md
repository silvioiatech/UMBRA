# Repository Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Successfully cleaned and organized the UMBRA repository structure for better maintainability and clarity.

## Changes Made

### üìÅ Directory Organization
Created four new directories to organize project files:

1. **`/tests`** - All test files (26 files)
2. **`/demos`** - Demo and example files (7 files) 
3. **`/scripts`** - Setup and utility scripts (6 files)
4. **`/docs`** - Documentation files (22 files)

### üìÇ File Movements

#### Tests Directory (`/tests`)
Moved all test files from root to organized test directory:
- All `test_*.py` files
- Integration test files (`f4r2_integration_test.py`, `f4r2_validate.py`, `system_test.py`)
- Added comprehensive `tests/README.md` with testing instructions

#### Demos Directory (`/demos`)
Organized all demonstration files:
- `bot2_demo.py`, `bot_mvp.py`
- `demo_mvp.py`, `demo_r2_simple.py`, `demo_r2_storage.py`
- `f4r2_demo.py`
- Added `demos/README.md` with usage instructions

#### Scripts Directory (`/scripts`)
Consolidated utility and setup files:
- Setup scripts: `setup.sh`, `setup_creator.sh`, `start_mvp.sh`
- Utility files: `creator_examples.py`, `fix_type_hints.py`
- Added `scripts/README.md` with script documentation

#### Documentation Directory (`/docs`)
Moved all documentation files:
- Architecture docs: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PROJECT_MAP.md`, `ACTION_PLAN.md`
- Feature docs: `F3R1_README.md`, `F4R2_README.md`, `CREATOR_README.md`, etc.
- Reports: All `PR_*.md` completion reports
- Status files: `STATUS_FINAL.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, etc.
- Added comprehensive `docs/README.md` with navigation guide

### üìù Documentation Updates

#### Updated Main README
- Refreshed architecture section to show new directory structure
- Updated documentation links to point to new locations
- Fixed testing instructions to use new test directory
- Added directory structure overview with links to each section

#### Added Directory READMEs
Each new directory includes a comprehensive README explaining:
- Purpose and contents
- Usage instructions
- File organization
- Navigation help

### ‚ú® Repository Root
Clean, focused root directory now contains only:
- Essential configuration files (`.env.example`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`)
- Main application files (`main.py`, `quickstart.py`)
- Deployment files (`Dockerfile`, `railway.json`)
- Core directories (`umbra/`, `tests/`, `demos/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`)
- Standard files (`.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`)
